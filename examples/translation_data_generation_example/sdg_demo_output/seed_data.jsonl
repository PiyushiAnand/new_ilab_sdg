{"document_outline":"General","document_title":"wikipedia\/\/document_1.md","domain":"General","icl_document":"Global blockchain company Binance has completed its acquisition of Swipe, the multi-currency digital wallet and Visa debit card platform, for an undisclosed amount.\nThe move helps accelerate plans for the company to widen the launch of its Binance Card, which will enable users to buy goods and services using cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin from outlets not normally used to trading in digital assets.\nBinance has run into problems implementing its own card idea, so Swipe\u2019s knowledge of the debit card industry and how it ticks could help push the Binance Card onwards past the concept stage.\nUltimately, Binance hopes the purchase of Swipe will take cryptocurrencies to a more mainstream market. The collaboration could end up bridging the gap between fiat and digital assets by making payments and purchases in cryptocurrency accessible via traditional financial systems.\nSwipe is undoubtedly a good match as its combination of digital wallet and Visa debit card features lets users buy, sell and convert cryptocurrencies. Users of Swipe can already pay with cryptocurrency in selected stores around the globe.\n\u201cTo achieve our mission of making crypto more accessible to the masses, off-ramps are a key component as well. By giving users the ability to convert and spend crypto directly, and have merchants still seamlessly accept fiat, this will make the crypto experience much better for everyone,\u201d said Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.\nSwipe has a growing profile in 31 countries across Europe and supports fiat transactions in Euros, British Pounds, US Dollars, Korean Won and Philippine Pesos. It has additional plans in place to launch in both Asia and North America.\nZhao, also known as CZ, recently highlighted the potential of payments using crypto in his Twitter feed, but conceded that with only 0.1% of people having crypto there was no real incentive for merchants to accept it. The CEO obviously hopes that buying Swipe will enable Binance to address the issue and incentivise merchants to become more open to accepting cryptocurrency.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nRob Clymo has been a tech journalist for more years than he can actually remember, having started out in the wacky world of print magazines before discovering the power of the internet.

This acquisition aligns with Binance\u2019s broader goal of mainstreaming cryptocurrency usage by bridging the gap between fiat and digital currencies, making crypto more accessible and usable in everyday transactions.","icl_query_2":"What advantages does Swipe bring to Binance, and how might it help overcome previous hurdles?","icl_response_2":"Swipe brings expertise in the debit card industry and a working infrastructure that already allows users to buy, sell, and convert crypto, and pay with crypto at selected stores globally. Binance had faced challenges implementing its own card system, so Swipe\u2019s operational know-how could help Binance move beyond the concept stage and launch its crypto card at scale.","icl_query_3":"What regions does Swipe currently operate in, and what are its future expansion plans?","icl_response_3":"Swipe currently operates in 31 countries across Europe and supports fiat currencies like the Euro, British Pound, US Dollar, Korean Won, and Philippine Peso. It also has plans to expand into Asia and North America, which could significantly broaden Binance\u2019s reach and user adoption in key global markets.","document":"Yet another batsman, who made his fastest fifty at 22 deliveries is Virender Sehwag.

Having made fifty off 22 deliveries, he eventually finished with 55 not out off 23 balls.
