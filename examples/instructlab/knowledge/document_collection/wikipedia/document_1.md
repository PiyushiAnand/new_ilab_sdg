Yet another batsman, who made his fastest fifty at 22 deliveries is Virender Sehwag. Sehwag is one of those batsmen, often known for going after the bowlers from the get-go and not sparing them no matter where he bats. While he seldom plays at a spot other than the opening one, the Delhi batsman didnâ€™t fail to bludgeon the Kenyan bowling at number three.
Skipper Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar put on an opening stand of 258 before Sehwag applied the finishing touches. Having made fifty off 22 deliveries, he eventually finished with 55 not out off 23 balls. The whirlwind knock consisted of seven fours and three sixes that carried India to 351 and deliver a win by 186 runs.
